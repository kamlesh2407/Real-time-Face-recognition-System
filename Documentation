To create a real-time face attendance system using Python and Firebase, you will need the following tools and libraries:

1. Python: You can download and install Python from the official Python website (https://www.python.org). Make sure to install a version compatible with your operating system.

2. Firebase: Create a Firebase account (https://firebase.google.com) and set up a new project. This will provide you with the necessary infrastructure to store and manage attendance data.

3. IDE: You can use any Python Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of your choice. Two popular options are PyCharm (https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm) and Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com).

4. Python Libraries:
   - OpenCV: A computer vision library for image and video processing.
   - NumPy: A library for numerical computations.
   - Firebase Admin SDK: A library for interacting with Firebase services.
   - Pillow: A library for image processing and manipulation.
   - Face Recognition: A library for face detection and recognition.

You can install these libraries using pip, the Python package installer, by running the following commands in your terminal or command prompt:

```
pip install opencv-python
pip install numpy
pip install firebase-admin
pip install Pillow
pip install face-recognition
```

Once you have all the required tools and libraries set up, you can start building your real-time face attendance system by following the steps outlined in the tutorial you mentioned (https://youtu.be/iBomaK2ARyI). The tutorial will guide you through the process of face detection, recognition, and storing attendance data in Firebase using Python.

Remember to refer to the official documentation and resources provided by the libraries and tools you are using for a more detailed understanding of their functionalities and usage.
